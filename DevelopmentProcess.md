# Development Process

## Overview
This document outlines the development process for the Architectural Discipline Package (ADP).

## Core Principles
1. **Language Agnostic**: ADP principles should apply across all supported languages
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Use data-driven approaches for architectural decisions
3. **Incremental Improvement**: Support gradual adoption of architectural discipline
4. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns and practices across all languages

## Development Workflow
1. Design language-agnostic interfaces first
2. Implement language-specific analyzers
3. Test with real-world code examples
4. Document patterns and thresholds
5. Update validation checklist

## Language Support
ADP currently supports:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (original)
- PowerShell (new)
- C# (new)
- Rust (new)

## Code Quality Standards
- All code must pass linting and type checking
- Tests required for new language analyzers
- Documentation must be updated for new features
